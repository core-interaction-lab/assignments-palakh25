    Palakh Khetrapal is a person who has always lived by the words “ rise like a phoenix from the ashes “ and has embraced every challenge that comes her way. Drawing since the age of 4, art to her has always been a form of expression. It grew from a hobby into a passion , as she won Best cartoonist at several MUNs and became the design head for her school MUN. A history enthusiast, she believes in the power of art to transform minds, cultures and societies. She honed her leadership skills as the Sec Gen of her school’s MUN and a part of the Student Council Body, an attribute that she’s going to use in her dream of making a change. Art is also her escape from reality, in a world with pink skies and purple trees. When she’s not with a paintbrush in her hand, you can find her hopping around in the kitchen cooking her favourite dishes.
    Always chasing her dreams and aiming for success, Palakh believes art has given her the power to have the conviction that there are no limits to dreaming and drawing and wishes to use her skill as a means to change society and inspire others to do the same. Pursuing Communication design at the Parsons school
    Of Design , she’s excited to step into the world of design and make her own mark!

    <h1><u>Design Harmony</u>  </h1>
    <p> In screen design, designers use the additive color model, where red, green and blue are the primary colors. Just as you need to strategically place images and other elements in visual design, your color choices likewise should optimize your users’ experience in attractive interfaces that have high usability. When starting your design process, you can consider using[DHM3] any of these main color schemes:</p>
    <article class="types">
      <h2>Monochromatic</h2>
      <p>Take one hue and create other elements from different shades and tints of it.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="types">
      <h2>Analogous</h2>
      <p>Use three colors located beside one another on the color wheel (e.g., orange, yellow-orange and yellow to show sunlight). A variant is to mix white with these to form a “high-key” analogous color scheme (e.g., flames).</p>
    </article>
    <article class="types">
      <h2>Complementary</h2>
      <p>Use “opposite color” pairs—e.g., blue/yellow—to maximize contrast.</p>
    </article>
    <article class="types">
        <h2>Split-Complementary</h2>
        <p>Add colors from either side of your complementary color pair to soften contrast.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="types">
        <h2>Triadic</h2>
        <p> Take three colors which are equally distant on the color wheel (i.e., 120° apart: e.g., red/blue/yellow). These colors may not be vibrant, but the scheme can be as it maintains harmony and high contrast. It’s easier to make visually appealing designs with this than with a complementary scheme.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="types">
        <h2>Tetradic</h2>
        <p>Take four colors that are two sets of complementary pairs (e.g., orange/yellow/blue/violet) and choose one dominant color. This allows rich, interesting designs. However, watch the balance between warm and cool colors.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="types">
        <h2>Square</h2>
        <p>A variant of tetradic; you find four colors evenly spaced on the color wheel (i.e., 90° apart). Unlike tetradic, square schemes can work well if you use all four colors evenly.</p>

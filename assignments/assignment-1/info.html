            Color wheel<br>

            The color wheel is a visual representation of colors, with hues arranged according to wavelength. Color wheels allow color relationships to be represented geometrically, and show the relationship between primary colors, secondary colors and tertiary colors.

            In the traditional RYB color wheel, the primary colors are red, yellow and blue. You can create secondary colors—orange, green, and purple—by mixing primary colors. Red and yellow create orange. Yellow and blue creates green. Red and blue creates purple. You remember this from elementary school, right?
            
            Then, mixing secondary colors and primary colors creates tertiary colors.
            
            Many different iterations of the color wheel exist, but many involving these three relationship types show a dozen colors.

            Modern Color Theory<br>
              Digital designers may be more familiar with an RGB color model with red, green and blue to mix light. Cyan Magenta Yellow Black, or CMYK, are the four basic colors for print images, and, as subtractive colors, get darker when blended.

            You were probably first introduced to the most basic color theory concept back in elementary school when you were given a palette of primary colors to paint with. Red, blue, and yellow are primary colors— and they can’t be created through mixing colors. Mix them all together and you get brown. But mix them and you can create all other colors.

            Color theory also involves a color’s darkness or lightness, or color values. You can change a color’s hue by adding white for tint, which will give you lighter pastel colors, and black for shade to darken and dull color. When gray is added to a primary, secondary or tertiary color, it creates a tone. If a color is toned down, its brightness and intensity is lessened.
            
            Once you add tints, shades, and tones, you get an expanded color wheel.
            
            Also, color theory involves how you arrange colors together to create schemes. For example, a monochromatic color scheme is one with one color in various tints and shades. Or, an analogous color scheme involves neighboring colors on the wheel, like red, orange and yellow.

            Complementary colors <br>


            When you’re pairing colors, you can find harmony through choosing complementary colors. In this case, opposites attract. This particular color scheme draws from two colors on the opposite side of the color wheel. When you do this, the result is a high-contrast color combo that’s bright and that pops.

Examples of complementary color combinations are: Red and green; yellow and purple; orange and blue; green and magenta. Complementary color combos tend to be bold, which is why sports teams often use this formula for their colors.

To throw in a third color, and make the color scheme less intense, you can use a split complementary color scheme. It uses one color as a base and two colors adjacent to its complement.

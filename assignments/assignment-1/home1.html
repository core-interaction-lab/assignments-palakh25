        <h1><u>Basic Color Theory</u>  </h1>

      
       
         
                Color theory encompasses a multitude of definitions, concepts and design applications - enough to fill several encyclopedias. However, there are three basic categories of color theory that are logical and useful : The color wheel, color harmony, and the context of how colors are used.

                Color theories create a logical structure for color. For example, if we have an assortment of fruits and vegetables, we can organize them by color and place them on a circle that shows the colors in relation to each other.
       
        
            <h2><u>The Color Wheel</u> </h2>
           <p> A color circle, based on red, yellow and blue, is traditional in the field of art. Sir Isaac Newton developed the first circular diagram of colors in 1666. Since then, scientists and artists have studied and designed numerous variations of this concept. Differences of opinion about the validity of one format over another continue to provoke debate. In reality, any color circle or color wheel which presents a logically arranged sequence of pure hues has merit.</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Primary Colors: </li>
           <li>Red, yellow and blue </li> 

 <li> In traditional color theory (used in paint and pigments), primary colors are the 3 pigment colors that cannot be mixed or formed by any combination of other colors. All other colors are derived from these 3 hues. </li>  

        <li> Secondary Colors: </li>
      
     <li>  Green, orange and purple  </li>   
    <li>  These are the colors formed by mixing the primary colors.   </li>  
<li>Tertiary Colors:  </li>
   <li>  Yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-purple, blue-green & yellow-green  </li>
